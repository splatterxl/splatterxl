## Introduction

### Summary

Splatterxl is a command-line utility to bring eternal pain to your workspace.

### Extensive, 50-paragraph essay about the usage of Splatterxl
Does not exist.

## Installation

Splatterxl can be downloaded in binary form in the [Releases] page (will only be updated when a *successful* build occurs) <!-- well, that explains the absence of a release --> or can be compiled from source.

A shell script to do that is provided:

```sh
# Clones the repository
git clone https://github.com/nearlySplat/source.git && cd source
# Builds the binary, it'll be dumped in `target/release`
make build

# Optional, run the binary
./target/release/splatterxl
```

## Usage

### Summary
```
splatterxl [file...]
```

### Extended Usage

None, since the developer is too lazy to add even one extra feature.
